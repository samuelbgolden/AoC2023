# Advent of Code 2023

See the event details [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

I'm doin' all RUST solutions. Run each by passing the input file like:

```
Get-Content .\resources\input.txt | cargo run
```

on Windows, or

```
cargo run < .\resources\input.txt
```

everywhere else.

To find my part 1 solutions, look in the commit history for the `main` file of each day.

## To revisit:

- **Day 5**: definitely missed some optimization
- **Day 10**: could be optimized too, but [produces a nice animation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NyHVYb-5Yb8YU7RwZ40DF1z_T5ACa4z3/view?usp=drive_link)!
