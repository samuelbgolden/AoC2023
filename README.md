# Advent of Code 2023

See the event details [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

I'm doin' all RUST solutions. Run each by passing the input file like:

```
Get-Content .\resources\input.txt | cargo run
```

on Windows, or

```
cargo run < .\resources\input.txt
```

everywhere else.

To find my part 1 solutions, look in the commit history for the `main` file of each day.

## To revisit:

- **Day 5**: definitely missed some optimization
- **Day 10**: could be optimized too, but [produces a nice animation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NyHVYb-5Yb8YU7RwZ40DF1z_T5ACa4z3/view?usp=drive_link)!
- **Day 12**: didn't complete part 2, runtime too long (also i lost a lot of my work on it somehow which is pretty de-motivating)
- **Day 14**: gives correct answer on input, but I aided the program by limiting the possible pattern length to only the length I observed in the load sequence. Could finish the pattern recognition code.
