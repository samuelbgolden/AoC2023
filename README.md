# Advent of Code 2023
See the event details [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023).

I'm doin' all RUST solutions. Run each by passing the input file like:
```
Get-Content .\resources\input.txt | cargo run
```
on Windows, or
```
cargo run < .\resources\input.txt
```
everywhere else.

To find my part 1 solutions, look in the commit history for the `main` file of each day.
